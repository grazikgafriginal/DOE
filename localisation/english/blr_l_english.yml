 BLR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The sun shone on already independent Belarus on March 25. Even though foreign troops were stationed on it, even though a foreigner has been and will continue to be used on it, the Belarusian people have thrown off the bonds of slavery from their souls, and no one and nothing will lift these bonds back."

######################################## IDEAS ########################################################
 BLR_unindustrial_state:0 "Unindustrial state" 
 BLR_unindustrial_state_desc:0 "Belarus is an agrarian country. Throughout 19th century Belarus lagged behind its industrializing neighbors due to a lack of natural resources, capital, technology, and infrastructure.\n\nPolitical instability and conflict further hindered its progress. The Brest-Litovsk Industrial District was established in 1912, but insufficient efforts were made to promote significant industrial growth. As a result, Belarus remained an unindustrialized state with poor economic development."

 BLR_the_eastern_neighbour:0 "The Eastern Neighbour"
 BLR_the_eastern_neighbour_desc:0 "Throughout the years, the relationship between Russia and Belarus has been marked by a complex mix of cooperation and tension. While the two nations share a long history and cultural ties, they have also experienced significant periods of conflict and disagreement.\n\nIn recent years, Russian aggression towards Belarus has been a particularly pressing concern. This aggression can take many forms, including economic pressure, political manipulation, and military intimidation."

 BLR_education_issue:0 "The Education Issue"
 BLR_education_issue_desc:0 "Belarus underwent significant changes in its education system as a result of Bulak-Balachovič policies. The new government aimed to increase literacy rates, promote the use of the Belarusian language, and create a standardized curriculum across the country. However, these reforms faced significant opposition from conservative elements within Belarusian society, who saw them as an attack on traditional values and the Russian language.\n\nDespite this opposition, the Bulak-Balachovič government made significant strides in improving education in Belarus. The number of schools and students increased dramatically, and the use of the Belarusian language became more widespread in schools and official documents. The government also made efforts to provide education to rural and working-class communities, which had historically been underserved."

 BLR_STANISLAV_BULAK_BALACHOWICZ_DESC:0 "Stanislaû Bulak-Balachovič was born on the 10th of February, 1883 born in the village of Turaû, in the Russian Empire which is now located in Belarus.\n\nOne of his nicknames became part of his surname. "Bulak" in his name means "cloud" or "a man who is driven by the wind".\n\nIn World War One after one of russian Grand Dukes address to the polish he joined the Russian Imperial Army, successfully leading multiple small units throughout the war and getting awarded multiple awards.\n\nBeing belarusian, he always despised the Russian Empire and the oppression of his people. Because of that, he always fought for belarusian independence and eventually achieved it.\n\nCalling him controversial would be an understatement. His people either view him as a brutal tyrant and a dictator, while other people view him as the hero of Belarus.\n\nBut only more time can tell if he is really the hero that his supporters call him"
