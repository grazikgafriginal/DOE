 ##### BOOOOOKMAAAARKS ######
 BLR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The sun shone on already independent Belarus on March 25. Even though foreign troops were stationed on it, even though a foreigner has been and will continue to be used on it, the Belarusian people have thrown off the bonds of slavery from their souls, and no one and nothing will lift these bonds back."

######################################## IDEAS ########################################################
 BLR_unindustrial_state:0 "Unindustrial state" 
 BLR_unindustrial_state_desc:0 "Belarus is an agrarian country. Throughout 19th century Belarus lagged behind its industrializing neighbors due to a lack of natural resources, capital, technology, and infrastructure.\n\nPolitical instability and conflict further hindered its progress. The Brest-Litovsk Industrial District was established in 1912, but insufficient efforts were made to promote significant industrial growth. As a result, Belarus remained an unindustrialized state with poor economic development."

 BLR_the_eastern_neighbour:0 "The Eastern Neighbour"
 BLR_the_eastern_neighbour_desc:0 "Throughout the years, the relationship between Russia and Belarus has been marked by a complex mix of cooperation and tension. While the two nations share a long history and cultural ties, they have also experienced significant periods of conflict and disagreement.\n\nIn recent years, Russian aggression towards Belarus has been a particularly pressing concern. This aggression can take many forms, including economic pressure, political manipulation, and military intimidation."

 BLR_remembrance_of_1918:0 "The Remembrance of 1918"
 BLR_remembrance_of_1918_desc:0 "The sun shone on already independent Belarus on March 25. Even though foreign troops were stationed on it, even though a foreigner has been and will continue to be used on it, the Belarusian people have thrown off the bonds of slavery from their souls, and no one and nothing will lift these bonds back."

 BLR_education_issue:0 "The Education Issue"
 BLR_education_issue_desc:0 "Belarus underwent significant changes in its education system as a result of Bulak-Balachovič policies. The new government aimed to increase literacy rates, promote the use of the Belarusian language, and create a standardized curriculum across the country. However, these reforms faced significant opposition from conservative elements within Belarusian society, who saw them as an attack on traditional values and the Russian language.\n\nDespite this opposition, the Bulak-Balachovič government made significant strides in improving education in Belarus. The number of schools and students increased dramatically, and the use of the Belarusian language became more widespread in schools and official documents. The government also made efforts to provide education to rural and working-class communities, which had historically been underserved."

######################################## LEADERS ########################################################

 BLR_STANISLAV_BULAK_BALACHOWICZ_DESC:0 "Stanislaû Bulak-Balachovič was born on the 10th of February, 1883 born in the village of Turaû, in the Russian Empire which is now located in Belarus.\n\nOne of his nicknames became part of his surname. "Bulak" in his name means "cloud" or "a man who is driven by the wind".\n\nIn World War One after one of russian Grand Dukes address to the polish he joined the Russian Imperial Army, successfully leading multiple small units throughout the war and getting awarded multiple awards.\n\nBeing belarusian, he always despised the Russian Empire and the oppression of his people. Because of that, he always fought for belarusian independence and eventually achieved it.\n\nCalling him controversial would be an understatement. His people either view him as a brutal tyrant and a dictator, while other people view him as the hero of Belarus.\n\nBut only more time can tell if he is really the hero that his supporters call him"

 BLR_ARKADZ_SMOLIC_DESC:0 "Like most Belarusians, he was born in the Minsk Province in the Russian Empire on the 29th of September, 1891. He was born into a priest family, but his most important thing in his life was learning and expanding his knowledge on everything he knew. \n\nBeing an important part of the Belarusian independence movement, he was always respected and was known as a hero who wants to educate his population. He is the one that wrote the "Geography of Belarus" which is still taught in Belarusian schools today. Working many jobs, studying in many schools he is a man of culture and knowledge. Being a social democrat he always wanted to make Belarus better and improve illiteracy, unemployment and much more problems that are like a plague currently in Belarus. All in all, a great patriot with a seemingly infinite amount of knowledge and love for his country. Being a teacher multiple times, he will teach the illiterate and Belarus on how to improve a nation to never seen before hights."

 BLR_JAN_SIERADA_DESC:0 "Jan was born into the Russian Empire, in the Minsk Governorate, into a village called Zadźvieji, in 1879. Not much is known about his youth because information is a hard thing to get from 1879. He fought for the Russian Empire in the Russo-Japanese war in 1905 and 1906. He also got mobilized when the Great War broke out across Europe, fighting in the trenches like everyone else at the time.\n\nHe graduated from a veterinary school at Warsaw in 1903 and worked as a veterinarian in 1907-1911 while also being a teacher at an agricultural college.\n\nAs a socialist he was an active member of the Belarusian Socialist Assembly and in 1917, he was the chairman of the First All-Belarusian Congress. A man with great knowledge when it comes to agriculture, love for his country and socialism, he will turn Belarus a nation better for the workers that need help the most."

 BLR_YAZEP_VARONKA_DESC:0 "Born in the Russian Empire into the Grodno Governorate on the 4th of April 1891.\n\nNot much is known about his early life, but its known that he studied at the Saint Petersburg State University from 1909 to 1914. In 1917, he joined the Belarusian Socialist Assembly and was the co-initiator of the First All-Belarusian Congress.\n\nHe was the first chairman of the People's Secretariat from 21th of February to May 1918. In the Russian Civil War, he got into contact with the lithuanian government at the outbreak of the Lithuanian-Soviet War and was appointed as the first prime minister of the Lithuanian Ministry for Belarusian Affairs, but was replaced by Dominik Semashko in May of 1920 simply because Semashko was more pro lithuanian.\n\nHe is a democrat and will bring freedom, equality and freedom of speech to all the people living in the great nation of Belarus. While doing all of this, he will give the people the right to choose their desired government, establishing free elections in Belarus."
